Ans 7. 
   


Ques 8:- Create a LVM
Ans 8:- To create a Logical Volume first we have to make a physical volume by

Then we have to create the volume group by 
sudo vgcreate vol_grp1 /dev/sda4
  

Then we have to create the Logical volume by
sudo lvcreate -l 20 -n logical_vol1 vol_grp1
To see the Logical volume we have to run command
